                I'm one of those imposters who has found himself lucky enough to

              <p>
                I've worked in real estate technology for the past 10 years.
                Honing my skills and hustling my way from answering support
                emails out of a gmail inbox, to designing custom reports w/ real
                estate brokers nationwide, to Senior Data Services Engineer at
                W+R Studios; hurdled through acquisition all the way to Front
                End Engineer at Lone Wolf Technologies.{" "}
                <span aria-label="rocket">üöÄ</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                In my tenure I've managed data integration to and from third
                parties (Multiple Listing Services, Brokers, and Data Partners)
                nationwide and mapped said data to be schematized and output via
                a GraphQL API to a suite of real estate agent facing SaaS
                products. <span aria-label="coder">üë®‚Äçüíª</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                This encompasses building/maintaining RETS, Web API, and SSO
                (SAML / JWT) integrations while working closely with the
                technical teams of thrid party partners to ensure smooth
                operation, security, and data integrity. <span aria-label='hammer and wrench'>üõ†Ô∏è</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                This includes daily management of 250+ individual data feeds
                (120M Listing Records, 12M Agent Records, ~500K daily updates),
                leading QA of each new integration (schedule, plan, meet launch
                dates), and finding solutions to problems that don't have
                answers. <span aria-label="monacle">üßê</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                One of those problems surfaced as a need to refactor the front
                end Data Pipeline ingestion tool I had been using over the years
                to serve real estate data to a suite of products with intent to
                expand support to 6 new applications and teams.{" "}
                <span aria-label="mucsle">üí™</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                I leveraged the battle hardened knowlege cultivated alongside a
                quest to level up my front end skills and refactored the entire
                front end in a new architecture (introduced Typescript,
                TailwindCSS, React Router, React Query and upgraded to React
                18); resulting in 5x data feed integration speeds and an
                abundance of adoption in all levels of the organization
                (support, sales, accounting, and development).
              </p>
              <p>
                In doing so, I've shifted into a Front End Engineering role
                where I drive innovation though focused UI/UX planning and
                execution. It's been quite the journey, and I wouldn't change a
                thing. <span aria-label="grin">üòÅ</span>

                  With a career born in finding solutions to problems that don't
                  have answers, I've honed a specified skillset for
                  troubleshooting any and all software and hardware issues. I
                  identify negative feedback loops and transform them into
                  positive feedback loops by leveraging logic and deduction. My
                  processes will isolate the root cause of a given problem and
                  allow multiple scenarios for resolution.

                  Effective communication and time management lead to prosperous

                  set the table and lead the client down the project path that
                  works best for their specific situation. Maleability and
                  finesse are leveraged to deliver a client experience that is
                  specifically attuned to their needs, wants, and desires.
