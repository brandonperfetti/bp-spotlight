# The Key of Gratitude

If you open your mind up to gratitude, other grateful things will come your way.

Doing so opens one up to amazing currents of quantum probability.

It's as easy as taking a moment to be grateful for being alive, for the air you breathe, your body that breathes it, and the realm your body inhabits.

To truly engage this gratitude, we must come in tune with our feelings, which oftentimes is very difficult.

> With the Master-Key in his possession, the student may unlock the many doors of the mental and psychic temple of knowledge, and enter the same freely and intelligently.

However, once you start to practice and work on it, you can maximize your grasp on these feelings and emotions.

The most powerful thing that you can do is to tune into the frequency of gratitude by expressing gratitude.

Gratitude is what you will feel if you have already achieved or manifested what you desire.

Everything is brighter and more wonderful when you take the time to treasure the moments with those you have ever shared a loving moment with.

> Who and what are you grateful for?

It doesn't have to be complicated. Just bring to mind what you're grateful for and just _**feel**_.

If you feel the reality of what that you want, and you understand the feeling of it, you end up broadcasting that feeling out, and you end up experiencing realities that tune in to that feeling.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6nULpn1BSphOHl7i/giphy.gif)

If you can maintain this vibration of gratitude within your mind, it will carry you in a tide, as a wave of fortune.

If you do so, anything is possible. _**Anything**_

> "Fortune falls heavily on those for whom she's unexpected. The one always on the lookout easily endures" - Seneca, On Consolation to Helvia, 5.3

Put positive thoughts out into the world for healing, compassion, love, and bringing unity between ourselves and the rest of humanity.

This may be the most powerful frequency that you can be on, and the more that you express and feel and tune in to gratitude, the more incredible things that you'll see in your life.

# The Biology of Belief

### The Hermetic Principal of Mentalism

`It explains that all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a mental creation of THE ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a whole, and in its parts or units, has it's existence in the Mind of THE ALL, in the Mind we "live and move and have our being." This Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such a large portion of public attention, and which, without such explanation, are non-understandable, and defy scientific treatment. An understanding of this great Hermetic Principal of Mentalism enables the individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to apply the same to his wellbeing and advancement... This principal explains the true nature of "Energy," "Power," and "Matter," and why and how all these are subordinate to the Mastery of Mind.`

> "He who grasps the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to Mastery."

Everything starts with a thought, with it being imagined into creation.

This being the case, the power of thought is quite incredible.

Most do not give enough scientific credence to investigate the power of thought for themselves.

Most talk about the supremacy of the speed of light, while the speed of thought is infinitely faster because thought is consciousness.

We are all connected by this consciousness; it's what links us together.

We have to keep in mind, that when we put a thought out into the universe, it projects that frequency and becomes a living thing.

That thought becomes a potentiality in one's experience.

> The more humble a person is, the freer and stronger he is.

Some protest, but this is evidence we are contributors to the creation of reality.

Cloaking one's thoughts in gratitude for the flow of the universe is the best way to leverage it's natural power in your favor.

# More Similar Than Different

While religion and spirituality are two completely different concepts, regardless of whether they're referred to as spiritual leaders or the higher ascended masters, they've all brought the same message.

They have all explained that the way that we change the world, the way that we can change things, is to look deep within.

By looking within, through the practice of meditation, we can begin to make the changes the world requires of us.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Z6ptpzWC9WgMw/giphy.gif)

Those who have truly meditated and gained beneficial experience from it, describe time almost as if it's passed without passing when you return.

It seems that meditation allows you to take yourself away from human physical consciousness and into a spirit consciousness.

While in a deep state of meditation, it's as if time becomes irrelevant and allows your consciousness to traverse realms and quantum dimensions.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/YrNaz4NLcgFb5NwJOU/giphy.gif)

> If traveling inward facilitates ascension to higher dimensions of consciousness, and hermetic principals value the mind as a contributor in the creation of the universe, gratitude can then be leveraged in battles that occur in higher dimensions to gain insight of the flow of the universe and how to use that to our benefit.

# Psychic War

At this time in the world, a litany of psychic energies bombard our minds day in and day out.

Those who have come to learn to work with energy know that these energies have been intense lately, and things generally have been like one huge emotional rollercoaster ride.

Some people, one minute are feeling on top of the world, and then the next day, a bomb drops and they just want to hide their head under the duvet and not even bother.

> "In short, you must remember this--that if you hold anything dear outside your own reasoned choice, you will have destroyed your capacity for choice." - Epictetus, Discourses, 4.4.23

The spiritual message is that hang in there.

Yeah. Hang in there. Things will work out.

However, it's difficult really to put that across to anybody who is in a state of fear at the moment, as emotions are running very high.

We have to remind ourselves, pretty much every day, that we're all working towards a better future for this planet.

In our heart of hearts, we all know that what we've been doing is wrong.

We cannot continue to live our lives subject to political oppression.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Zt4S47UFpL2s77i/giphy.gif)

There was a better world than this.

We can do better than this.

Humanity is better than this.

> "You'll more quickly find an earthly thing kept from the earth than you will a person cut off from other human beings." Marcus Aurelius Meditations 9.9.3

Every single one of us now has got to work on focusing on uniting rather than being divided politically.

We've got to rise above politics. It no longer works. It never did work. It only ever worked against us.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/0Av9l0VIc01y1isrDw/giphy.gif)

We've got to find that common ground now to work on, as a race of beings who wish to inhabit this planet and work with it in harmony to live our lives freely.

Stop vibrating at a frequency that blinds you from your divinity.

> "With humbleness, kindness, and self-sacrifice, you will take the weapon from any enemy. Any fire dies if there is insufficient wood" - Buddhist Wisdom

Have gratitude for your neighbor who doesn't see eye to eye.

Engage in discourse. Repair what has been broken.

# Soul Fragmentation

Whenever we suffer physical or emotional trauma, it is said that a part of our soul flees the body to survive the experience of every cut and wound.

Through this process, our essence and vitality grow weaker. This is known soul fragmentation.

It's what happens when we become disconnected from the very core of ourselves, the source of our vitality, our soul.

Soul fragmentation, contrary to popular belief does not mean losing your soul.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/14uQ3cOFteDaU/giphy.gif)

Rather, it refers to the experience of losing touch with your soul.

Your soul is always there in the backdrop of your life, but it's not always accessible due to psychological traumas, abuses, and blockages that have taken root within your mind.

Soul fragmentation, or dissociation, are devices that the brain uses to survive potentially destructive traumatic events.

In other words, soul loss happens to protect you initially rather than to hurt you. This is a natural protective mechanism.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOwFXOqN9Jd8OdktO/giphy.gif)

However, every wound must be healed, otherwise, it festers.

When we neglect to heal these blocked off parts of ourselves and give them air, we are left with a chronic feeling of unwholeness.

Eventually, we can suffer from chronic issues, such as anxiety, depression. Physical, and mental illness also result.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif8V09vBtyRFVU4/giphy.gif)

It can wreak havoc in our lives and starve us of our fundamental vitality.

We wind up feeling confused, lost, anxious, depressed, overwhelmed by the shadowy parts of us.

> So how do we regain connection with our souls?

We do this through soul retrieval, which is a shamanic term that refers to reintegrating lost soul parts back into a person to facilitate healing.

Soul retrieval can be understood as the practice of reintegrating dissociated and repressed parts of the psyche back into everyday consciousness for greater wholeness.

By practicing soul retrieval we're removing the blockages that obscure our souls and ultimately create more inner peace and harmony.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYxObOQE9sXM640/giphy.gif)

These realms are often inaccessible and are guarded by heavy defenses that make it difficult or even impossible for the affected person to go through on their own.

However, the retrieval of these pieces is not the end.

We must learn how to integrate them back into our lives to recover our vital power.

Over time, soul fragmentation resulting from not integrating these traumatic experiences can become quite an obstacle in our personal development.

> "Success comes to the lowly and to the poorly talented, but the special characteristic of a great person is to triumph over the disasters and panics of human life." Seneca, on Providence, 4.1

# Fighting back

Truth radiates. Therefore, we must be conscious and aware.

Conscious that we are these conduits for information.

Aware that our DNA is the physical conduit of the divinity of our whole conscious being, both in terms of body and spirit.

It's all combined into little strings of DNA that build our world and our bodies, but also connect us with higher consciousness.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Pl7MhjWSvFwzu/giphy.gif)

We're sold on the fact that everything is physical.

In psychological terms, brain function is physical as the brain is considered a machine, controlled by hormones and electrical impulses (which it is don't get me wrong).

However, we seem to leave out the spiritual aspect of everything, the actual consciousness part of it; which no scientific instrument right at this moment in time can measure.

> "Don't seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but rather wish that everything happens as it actually will -- then your life will flow well." - Epictetus, Enchiridion, 8

We're locked into this kind of consciousness trap that's been put upon us from birth, through schooling, through university, through life experience.

We don't want to go through this life, in a state of fear, being controlled by others who are exerting their will over us, and doing so with threats.

A web of deceit has been spun around the planet.

It is of the finest filament and one which many cannot see or feel.

It can be likened to a thin veil, subtle but heavily disguised as the truth, which lies behind it.

The human brain can be programmed to become subservient, but the soul cannot.

> "Beware of those who want to convince you that it is impossible to strive for good because it is impossible to reach perfection" -John Ruskin

# Have a Soul Conscious Experience

We change the world as we change our perception of the world.

If we have that ability to be able to change our perception of the world, then the world takes on a whole new shape and meaning.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xxpDp9J4Jlv62Q/giphy.gif)

Many who practice meditation have been somewhere and found that zero point, this connection with soul consciousness.

Start listening to the inner self, looking within for the answers rather than looking outward.

Turn off the TV and any form of information that does not serve you, feels wrong, or is negatively transmitting frequencies that are not in harmony with the human being.

> "The person who follows reason in all things will have both leisure and a readiness to act--they are at once both cheerful and self-composed." - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 10.12b

Listen to the heart, and know that we've got this amazing transmitter and receiver of information, that can be better enabled through meditation.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xThuWm6jSxHk4kubPG/giphy.gif)

Rise out of the political game, because politics is just another low vibration distraction.

It's a vibration that we need to crawl our way out of. Know we're not left, we're not right, we're just here, now.

Just be grateful for this very moment that you're in right now.

We're human beings and deep down, we all want the same results.

We all want to be able to live our lives in freedom.

That's what the best of people desire.

They just want to live freely.

They've got no interest in doing any harm.

They've got no interest in dominating or controlling anyone outside of themselves.

# Conclusion

Feel the gratitude for this moment, this present moment.

Slow time down and tune into this moment.

Be mindful of it as much as you can and feel gratitude for every single second that goes by.

Notice the flow of time and let it slow down and come into this moment.

Let this feeling take over and become this moment, the gratitude for this moment, radiating outwards around you like waves of gratitude.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l41YAIEcDQGKgu5BC/giphy.gif)

Resonate this frequency of gratitude.

Anything that you can think of to be grateful, let it come to your mind, and just focus on the gratitude.

The more you do this, the more incredible things can happen. Let it take you over.

Program this into your mind.

Look for the gratitude first before you look for anything else.

Be grateful for whatever happens.

If it's pain, it's a lesson.

If it's a bad occurrence, that means that something worse has been averted.

Program yourself to become grateful for every single moment and let that spread through your whole body.
