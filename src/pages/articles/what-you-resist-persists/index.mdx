> "While it's true that someone can impede our actions, they can't impede our intentions and our attitudes, which have the power of being conditional and adaptable. For the mind adapts and converts any obstacle to it's action into a means of achieving it. That which is an impediment to action is turned to advance action. The obstacle on the path becomes the way" – [Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.20](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Thrift-Editions-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/048629823X)

## Anxiety Provoking Resistance

Let's pause on discussing action and talk about the negative space, **inaction**.

Why is it that we occasionally let our [**~~fears and anxieties~~**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear) dictate the things we choose not to act on?

_Why do we so easily stick our heads in the sand?_

It comes down to a biological function, sometimes referred to as [**fear paralysis**](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/paralysis).

Essentially, you believe that you are in a situation where a fight or flight response is required, yet since that may not be objectively true, the option to freeze (inaction) is often opted for.

The thing is, resisting that which you [**fear**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear) is not the best way to rid yourself of said fear.

**That which is resisted will continue to persist.**

## Pendulums and Polarization

_Stuff happens..._

It's all about choosing to _**respond**_ rather than _**react**_; that's what shapes your reality.

A response is _**insightful**_.

A reaction is pure _**emotion**_.

_Imagine yourself as a [**pendulum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum#1851:_Foucault_pendulum)._

This pendulum strives for [**equilibrium**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium), yet is constantly swayed (for positive or negative) by the many other pendulums it comes in contact with.

External pendulums are out of one's control.

If equilibrium is not a virtue, the pendulum is subject to [**polarization**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)>).

Regardless, the pendulum shall swing, however, it's your responsibility to bring the pendulum back to equilibrium.

Most are aware that this is easier said than done, which begs the question, how does one actively guard against exterior pendulums, to retain equilibrium?

## Transmuting a Negative Frequency into a Positive Frequency

It is possible to absorb energy from a negative pendulum and never give any in return.

Imagine absorbing the energy of a negative pendulum without giving any back.

Let it pass by with indifference.

Collect its energy and use it for future causes in meditations and life.

Ponder the pendulums you encounter and how they came into existence.

Gather in the excess energy of these pendulums and allow it to be used positively.

## Fear and Anxiety Will Drain You

The strongest vibrational string a pendulum can pluck is **~~fear~~**, the most powerful and ancient of human emotions.

If fear is associated with any aspect of a pendulum, it will absorb the energy of that which it makes contact.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKEP6YngkCKFofC/giphy.gif)

It's cousins, **~~anxiety and worry~~**, are weaker emotions but are also relatively effective control mechanisms.

These emotions affect the attuning of your pendulum's equilibrium.

**~~Guilt~~** is also one of the most extensive channels pendulums utilize to siphon energy; imposed on us in childhood by convenient methods of [**manipulation**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion)#Cultural_views>).

It's hard to live with.
People try to rid themselves of guilt by punishment or writing the wrong.

Unfortunately, people have various [**psychological complexes**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion)#Defenses>) that activate fear-based negative pendulums.

If you allow them, pendulums such as these will try to strike a vibrational chord and begin intensely absorbing your energy.

You must become [**antifragile**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile) to external pendulums.

## Energy Vampires

_Imagine you’re surrounded by [**energy vampires**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_vampire)._

To survive, cultivate your energy and visualize a force field of it around you that facilitates the choice of who/what you give your energy to and who/what you get your energy from.

To control this energy field, let go of the fear and the guilt in your life, **all of it**.

Go through **everything** you’re afraid of.

These are only emotions/feelings in your body that broadcast out energetic vibrations that someone/something else is sucking out of you, like a vampire.

## Combating Fear

Let go of your deepest fears.

They serve you in no way.

_**It's your choice**_.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgO6eylAYeIZFhC/giphy.gif)

When you begin to feel fearful, do not allow it to consume you.

Rather, connect it to the feeling of love and joy, allow your adrenal glands to relax.

_**Let joy and happiness envelop you**_.

Let go of all guilt in your life, it's all in the past.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xTeV7WSeybMQrIMPhS/giphy.gif)

Whatever guilt you feel, it was caused by a person that does not exist anymore.

Your [**cells**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth) are replaced regularly, and the person you are feeling guilty for is an entirely different person than the one before you today.

To counter, do your absolute best to resonate frequencies of joy, happiness, and gratitude.

_**Free yourself of the emotions those negative pendulums use to manipulate you.**_

## Know When to Say No

Your ability to choose how you respond rather than react is a noble skill.

However, one must also learn how to decline.

Most people have a vague idea of what they do want but _somehow_ know **exactly** what they do not want.

To get rid of things they do not want, people act in a manner that has the opposite effect of what they may had initially intended.

Avoidance of the beast allows it to grow stronger, it must be met head-on to be vanquished.

_**To decline something, you have to first accept it’s existence.**_

The word accept, in this context, does not mean to embrace it and let it into your personal space.

It means acknowledging it’s right to existence.

To accept and let go of something means to consider the meaning of a thing (why it is the way it is) and letting it pass.

This is more effective than letting something into your personal space, becoming attached to it, and then attempting (with all your might) to oppose it.

More on [**declinism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declinism#Cause) and it's relation to the mind.

## Manifest Your Reality

When you obsess about things you do not want, you attract them further into your life.

Doing so leaves you vulnerable to exterior pendulums.

It does not matter what you love or hate, if your thoughts are latched on to an object of your emotions, your thought energy will be attuned to that certain frequency.

_Let go of your fears. Let go of your guilt._

**Its a matter of necessity. Its a matter of survival.**

If you want to eradicate something from your life, all you have to do is not think about it.

Pass by those pendulums with [**indifference**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference).

To eliminate something from your life, you must begin by becoming indifferent to it.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/bqalUGFYfyHzW/giphy.gif)

> DO NOT AVOID IT

What you avoid, you let it into your personal space and it begins to absorb your energy.

By avoiding it you bring more of it.

True protection from a pendulum is to be indifferent to it.

When you are indifferent, it passes you by, dissipating into space, without causing any harm.

_**A pendulum cannot affect you if you’re empty in relationship to it.**_

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6NUe6XgK41gKMo/giphy.gif)

## You're the One Flying the Plane

When turbulence approaches, keep a sense of humor and a strong imagination to slow the swinging of your pendulum.

> "Space cadet, pull up..."

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Btn42lfKKrOzS/giphy.gif)

If you have no cards to play, simply write yourself out of the equation.

_Become detached._

Play the game, but become observant.

Become aware of the pendulum and let it move on.

## Conclusion

Resistance is _futile_.

Our goal is to raise our vibration to become best aware of the many pendulums in our lives, and that we have the power to navigate through them; choosing a better future.

[**Fear is only an illusion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear#Fear_of_the_unknown).

We create fear in our minds about a potential future.

[**Danger**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/danger) is what is real, and we must be aware of what the danger is, to prepare for the _actual future_.

_**Do right and fear no man**_.

> “I urge you to dream nobly. Although your dream may seem impossible, invite it into your consciousness by feeling it is real. Wear this feeling as you would a suit of clothes, and persist until the feeling takes on the tones of reality. Do that, and in a way no one knows, your desire will appear as an eruption of your continuous thought. – [Neville Goddard](https://www.neville-goddard.org/)
