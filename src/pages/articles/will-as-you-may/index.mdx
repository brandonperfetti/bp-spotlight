# What is Affirmative Will?

Your affirmative will is capable of unlocking the forces of your mind.

Most people oscillate between not knowing what to do, and not acting.

Affirmative will summons all the forces of your conscious and subconscious minds into a positive, dynamic, focal point; driving you to your objective without hesitation or hindrance.

_**There are two opposing forces in life and man is forced to choose between the two.**_

The will to succeed and the will to fail.

Live or die.

Love or hate.

Rich or poor.

Peace or war.

_Man must choose his destiny._

Because man can choose his destiny, he is different from all other living creatures, in that he has the power of choice.

By exercising your affirmative will you can select the events that make up your destiny.

The artist chooses the scenes he paints and the colors with which to paint.

If he is not pleased with what is on the canvas, he has only himself to blame.

This is so, as his inability to accurately produce the scene from nature, ultimately, displeases him.

# Passive Will and Affirmative Will

There are two types of will in life, passive will, and affirmative will.

A passive will can create mental images of success and riches, those of which it is unable to formulate into reality.

Many would-be millionaires lack the affirmative will to place their daydreams into motion.

# How to Effectively Utilize Affirmative Will

The will is fashioned from the mental habit patterns that you build from the time you were born.

Think of things like rising rituals or getting ready in the morning.

You do not give conscious attention to these acts for you have built habit patterns that take care of most of them.

If your habit patterns have been negative, and your mind is filled with thoughts of fear, failure, and disaster, your auto conditioning will all be in favor of these negative emotions and your actions will be correspondingly negative.

Change the habit patterns of your mind from negative to positive through the power of your affirmative will.

> How do you change your habit patterns?

The same way they were created.

By performing the mental or physical act over and over until it is so deeply ingrained into your consciousness, it becomes automatic.

Then we call the action a **habit**.

# Use Creative Commands to Your Higher Consciousness

The higher centers of your brain are stirred into action by creative commands.

Let these be given each morning as you start your daily activities, then throughout the day, use energy boosters to keep your spirits high and your energy peaked.

### Energy Boost Examples

- “I feel wonderful"
- "I'm able to overcome this problem."
- "I'm now dissolving these obstacles through the power of my will."

# This too shall pass

Try not to let negative life experiences prove too discouraging.

The affirmative will must be exercised every day of your life, otherwise you are apt to slip into negative and passive habit patterns that affect your entire, future destiny.

Every day, exercise your immense will to live.

> Have an intense desire to live for some specific cause or person.

Strive to educate your children.

Own your home.

Desire a fortune to Help others.

The more altruistic and unselfish your purpose for living the greater will be the life energy that flows from your higher mind.

Many people lose the will to live because they have no one to live for and nothing they wish to accomplish.

When people are motivated by a desire to live for some purpose, they often have a release of the life force that keeps them going well past the average life span.

A renewed sense of creating helps stimulate the forces of your brain; infusing body cells with life-giving energy and purposefulness.

# Conclusion

Every day, exercise the affirmative will to succeed.

Do this by planning each day’s activities with one thought in mind, to make it as successful as possible.

Focalize your mind's energies on things you want to accomplish.

Make a list each day of the things you need and want to do on that day.

Use a planner for the future.

_**A neat and orderly mind ensures a neat and orderly life and destiny.**_

> "You say, good fortune used to meet you at every corner. But the fortunate person is the one who gives themselves a good fortune. And good fortunes are a well-tuned soul, good impulses and good actions." - [Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations)

# Extra Credit

Try to exercise daily the affirmative will to attract more money.

Money is an idea more than it is an actual material thing.

In ancient times, goods were used as [**money**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money#Medium_of_exchange).

Ie; tea, fir, stones, iron, tobacco.

You can only attract more money when it becomes a habit pattern of your thinking, every day.

Of college graduates, those that are successful in achieving their life goals, did so because they trained daily to think in terms of being successful in their chosen profession.

_They formed the mental habit patterns of success._

Every time you spend a dollar think of its [**value**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money#Measure_of_value).

Money works under the [**law of the harvest**](https://bible.org/article/seven-laws-harvest).

When you plant a seed in the ground it usually produces 10x the yield of the original seed.

When you give money out, be sure to bless it and know that it will yield you abundance.
