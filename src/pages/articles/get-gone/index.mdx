# How You Play Is What You Win

We're going to build off the concept of reality being derived by the observer (evidenced through quantum mechanics, and discussed in my previous article).

As the observer, you have mastered your sensory perception of matter and tuned your mind to be properly informed by it.

This allows leverage over exterior factors through your response to them.

The world is a [**stage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world's_a_stage) where every man and woman must play their part.

As is with many other things in the world, if you don't choose a role to play, someone has already chosen for you.

_**Which role are you choosing to play? Have you found it? Are you looking?**_

The roles we choose to play inform our day to day decisions, and underly the fabric of our response.

The fabric of our response is then used to weave the costume our role demands.

> How could we further craft our response to better suit the role we choose to play?

How could we better the fabric of our response to [adorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adornment) ourselves as we wish?

Doing so requires finding out who you are, and becoming.

In finding out who you are, introspection is required.

Introspection must be coupled with _vipassanā_ (understanding mind-body coherence).

Finding out who you are will require an understanding of both your material and your spiritual self.

Introspection can take you quite far in the material.

However, vipassanā is the jet fuel required to meet the heights of your spiritual self.

Once you begin to play the role you are meant to, the game of life becomes quite simple, and previously daunting obstacles will reveal themselves as paths of refinement.

# Outer Intention

Our intention and goal is to align the heart and mind, for if we can do that, anything is possible.

Our heart is the key to witnessing reality, it's changes, and how we may change it.

It is through the heart that our best intentions of the mind are derived.

These intentions are stem from heart-mind coherence.

Through heart-mind coherence, we can achieve congruency and shift into our happiest of realities.

> "Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony." -[Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Principles,_practices,_and_beliefs)

# Drowning in Information While Starving for Wisdom

Before we can engage in heart-mind coherence we must clear the mind of the noise drowning our hearts intent.

To do so, we must engage our focal consciousness with the signal amongst the noise.

> “Where there is a wealth of information, there is a poverty of attention.” - [Herbert Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon)

Our problem today is that there is so much stimulus - it’s hard to find the signal in the noise.

It’s hard to find our sense of self.

To find what you must do, you must delve within by tuning into what matters.

The trouble with the noise is that we’ve forgotten how to tune in to what matters.

# Tuning In To What Matters - Engaging Your Heart

Close your eyes and stop the mental chatter.

Contemplate the blackness.

By contemplating this blackness you manage not to think for a short period.

For a moment your mind will be empty, and yet you do not stop being yourself in this moment.

The activity of the mind is temporarily halted, but a sense of integrity of the self remains.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/KDhIlswr3Lf8k5rqO3/giphy.gif)

> How do you explain that you, are, in fact, you?

An awareness of personal identity comes from one's social environment.

Imagine for one second that your social environment has dissipated and you're just hanging in the same empty space in the cosmos.

There is no Earth, no Sun, no past, no future.

Just black emptiness.

Everything else has disappeared.

All that remains is you.

> What of your former personality?

If all knowledge and thoughts, manners, habits, fears, characters and pursuits were based on your previous environment, what would remain of the self?

Feel this void.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/d48u7mcJ4KUn4K1W/giphy.gif)

Witness the infinite spark of intelligence.

Awareness. Feelings. Movement. Energy. Flow.

Yearning to experience, to live, to feel, to observe.

> Where does this feeling come from? Hint: The Heart

The heart was given to you. As long as it beats, you live.

Radiate love and gratitude for all that your heart brings to you; The way it pumps the blood in your body and the way that blood flows. It's incredible.

Treat your heart with the respect it deserves. Listen to it's voice.

Let your heart radiate out and connect with the alternative space around you. The space of variations.

Feel abundance, gratitude, joy, security, safety, and comfort right now, in your heart.

Move and seek out a place to express your life once again.

Have you forgotten who you are or do you remember? Search this void.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btRAkGEaa11Mu6A/giphy.gif)

_**This is the process of tuning into what matters.**_

This opens the doors to tremendous knowledge and power, lying dormant in your heart.

Tuning into what matters is tuning into the spark of intention within your heart.

However, for your heart to truly meet your mind, your mind must let go of its attachments, its fears, and its concerns.

# Killing Your Idols Through Intellectual Anarchism

Much of the chatter that consumes our minds is not our own.

Many of the attachments, fears, and concerns that keep the mind active at night are born of our idolization of others and institutions.

We allow our intuition to be stifled by what we believe others may think of us.

To truly clear our minds, we must kill those idols we've clung to in fear.

They must be scrutinized until their power falls at the feet of our discernment and logic.

Belief is the enemy of knowing.

To know what your heart truly intends, your mind must stop simply believing what it's been told.

You see, your higher mind's discernment skills must be engaged for the heart to trust it's direction and vice versa.

This means testing that which you think you know and giving power to only that which holds truth value.

Intellectual freedom of the mind is paramount to developing a heart-mind coherence.

# The Myth of Significance or Misplaced Significance

In addition to killing our external idols, we must also do the necessary work of humbling the grandest idol of all, ourselves.

As a society, we've come to engage in a myth of significance. We're the star of our movie.

We've put our faith in being chosen, becoming ‘the one’. Striving to be bigger, noticed, or more than, while simultaneously recounting a narrative of never enough.

In the minds of society, significance holds a title, resides in a corner office, speaks from the center stage, gaining recognition far and wide.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/26DoiqmYcxgFICb3G/giphy.gif)

True significance, however, hides in plain sight; carrying out seemingly small, unimportant acts, with intention and conviction, without permission, rewriting the future.

True significance is the work of the heart.

Your mind must learn the subtle and humble language of your heart to best engage in its intentions.

# If You Want To Win the Game, Don’t Play

You have to actively not play the societal games the myth of significance places us in.

There's a way to be in the world that makes the universe better (if done correctly) by being on the side of promoting life; in all places.

Engagement with everything life has to offer and being connected to nature are the most effective ways to win the game.

In doing so, you define the game and it's rules; shifting the goalposts in your favor.

> “We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. So medicine, law, business, engineering... these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love... these are what we stay alive for.” ― [Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass)

# Heart-Mind Coherence Through [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism)

Taoism is a philosophical tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao.

The Tao is the source, pattern, and substance of everything that exists.

We naturally and inherently understand what it means to be good humans, in touch with the natural world around us.

Engaging with the flow of nature, in all its positive and negative products, allows us to engage in awareness.

With a cleared mind, we're able to tune into nature; opening the path connecting our heart.

Taoism allows the heart to be heard by the mind by speaking to its senses through nature; allowing for simplicity, patience, and compassion.

> “Simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.” ― [Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching)

# Engage in Radical Self-sovereignty

A human knows the right way to be in the world. It's our sovereign duty to behave as such.

Keeping communication flowing between the heart and mind requires a heart-mind coherence mindset, fueled by radical self-sovereignty.

Below are some affirmations to help engage in radical self-sovereignty:

- I am a sovereign being of light.
- I am infinite.
- I am a vessel for the truth.
- I am love flowing to and from itself.
- My heart and my cup are full.
- I am endless flow.
- Every cell in my body radiates light.
- I'm happy where I am and eager to be going where I am going.
- I am harmony.
- I am source energy.
- Life is my biggest ally.
- I am in a daily state of total alignment in thought, word, feeling, and action; with the ease of my knowing.
- I have perfect health, a powerful energy field, and inner peace.
- I am calm and confident.

# Mind Your Heart Strings - Communicating With Your Heart

Your heart is connected to all the possible variations and universes all around you.

Your heart can send you two signals. Discomfort or comfort.

Listen to your heart with each decision you make. Do not tune it out.

If your heart sends you a signal that it's uncomfortable about a decision you're making, listen very carefully.

In this moment, ask your heart any question and honestly evaluate the response your heart gives.

Begin a dialogue with your heart.

Tell your heart that you are listening.

Open yourself up and shut down the chatter of your mind that wants to analyze everything.

Let go and listen to your heart.

The mind can make a perfect copy, but only the heart is capable of the original.

All you have to do is accept the axiom that the heart has everything it needs and then give yourself the joy of making the most of it.

Focus for a moment on the connection you've made between the heart and mind.

Breathe in through your heart. Breathe out through your heart.

Begin to let your heart be your guide. Become aware of how to speak the language of the heart.

# Conclusion

Vipassanā teaches us that the mind affects the body and the body affects the mind.

We must cleanse our minds and allow our hearts to speak their intentions through our actions.

Engaging in nature and avoiding the pitfalls of societal pressure allows one to develop heart-mind coherence.

Heart-mind coherence allows one to leverage vipassanā to best navigate probable realities and exist in this universe.

You've engaged in heart-mind coherence.
