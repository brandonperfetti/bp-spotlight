# The More Simple an Idea The More Potent It Can Become

One generally strives for simplicity to curb an already procacious situation.

Something appears as difficult, so the solution _must_ be to remove difficulties from the situation, and add more **simplicity**.

While this approach may be effective in the short term, it disregards root cause, and lacks the foresight in not acknowledging future difficulties that may arise from applying such a band-aid.

Perhaps there is a more efficacious approach that simplifies the situation in the long term.

Let us propose a more simple and holistic approach to deriving simple solutions.

An approach that addresses the root cause of a difficulty, which generally stem from inflation of ego and/or lack of perseverance.

If one were to look inward and focus on these two aspects of themselves, not only will difficulties they unknowingly impose on others dissipate, solutions to their problems will ultimately make themselves known.

Engaging in these precepts allows one to be like water.

_**Calm**_ on the surface so that it may reflect that which surrounds it.

_**Cool**_ to the touch so that it may refresh that which it comes in contact.

_**Collected**_ in its environment, only moving with the natural flow of distribution.

_Simple in its awareness of itself._

# Own Your Ego

Most people who fail in life do so because they are utilizing the wrong type of [**ego**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoism).

They are so obsessed with excessive self-interest, they lose their perspective, and ignore the rights and interests of others.

Such people are called [**egotists**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egotism).

This type of egotism is destructive and causes people to dislike one another.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/eMu0803X2zkWY/giphy.gif)

However, we do need ego, for a great deal of self-interest, and purposes of self-preservation.

In our metaphysical studies, we convert this power of the psyche, which consciously controls the impulses of the [**Id**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Id), as it is called in psychology, into the divine ego.

The changes in your personality and ego will be miraculous once you institute this method; unlocking the forces of your mind.

# How to Build the Divine Ego

Regardless of your faith, realize that you were created in the image and likeness of Source.

This is a spiritual idea rather than a physical one.

When you accept the premise that you are divine and immortal, then you will begin to be divine in your thoughts and actions.

[**Voltaire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire) said to be a hero, think heroic thoughts.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/17mGDCFnG3592dnoHa/giphy.gif)

To be divine, you should pattern your thoughts and actions after the divine image.

> What are the divine thoughts and images you should emulate?

Source is good, and good is love.

If you pattern your thinking with goodness and love, with all the ramifications, you cannot help but reverberate a frequency of goodness and love in all your relationships.

# Cultivate the Habit of Unselfish Actions Towards Others

_Share your good and happiness with other people._

Instead of talking about yourself and your problems, make it a point to take an interest in others and their activities.

Work on community projects, enter into charity drives, volunteer for public welfare groups.

Such expanded interests do more than help the unfortunate.

They help you by building the divine ego, which can enrich your life and give you blessings of health happiness and prosperity, by releasing the forces of your higher mind.

# Have a Higher Master Motive in Your Life

Desire success and money not only for yourself and your family, but also so you can help better the world through your creative efforts.

Many motives propel a man to his destiny: power, money, fame, glory, wisdom, material things, peace, brotherhood, tolerance...

The higher your master motive, the greater the drive for success and fulfillment.

_Spiritualize your mind and find new dimensions of the soul._

# Overcome Animalistic Emotions: Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, and Envy

The divine image within your consciousness cannot flourish in such an atmosphere of negativity.

Implant, in your consciousness, the positive forces of charity, beauty, truth, justice, faith, and love; and soon you will see the divine inspiration that flows through your consciousness, from the divine mind within you.

Spend a few moments each day in spiritual contemplation and meditation.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btSlEkVbvtjkW3K/giphy.gif)

In such mystical periods, search within for life’s true meaning.

Try to find the divine prototype within your immortal soul.

Pray for guidance and inspiration every morning and night.

When you feel the gravity pull of earth's problems, fears, and worries, stop, and retire for a moment into the cathedral of your soul and say to yourself:

_**“Peace, be still, and know that I am Source.”**_

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/2xtqI9V0ogEj6/giphy.gif)

The following powerful affirmative spiritual statement from the bible reaffirms your sense of divinity and will allow you once more to instill peace and tranquillity within your consciousness.

_**“Let each man think himself an act of God. His mind a thought, and his life a breath of God."**_

# Perseverance Always Wins

Perseverance is the ability to continue doing something, despite difficulties or opposition.

Many times, a person who wishes to succeed will stop making the effort because of the many obstacles they have to face.

If they persisted just a bit longer, in many cases, they will have undoubtedly have achieved their goal.

You may be on the verge of achieving your greatest success, if you only persevere a bit longer, and don’t give up.

By fulfilling the promise you make to yourself in jest, there is a powerful, stimulating force within your psyche that works miracles when you respond to the challenges of life with perseverance and courage.

# How to Utilize Perseverance

Work with the law of cycles in nature.

There is a time in every life when fate presents a set of circumstances that can bring one success and fortune.

Learn how to study, be aware of these cycles, and take advantage of opportunities that arise with confidence.

[**Shakespeare**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare) spoke of these cycles in our lives:

> "Brutus: There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures." - [**Julius Caesar Act 4, scene 3, 218–224**](https://www.enotes.com/topics/julius-caesar/text/act-iv-scene-iii#root-71646-111)

# Alive Time

When you come to those periods of stagnation in your life when nothing seems to happen, learn how to best utilize that time.

Study and prepare your mind for the time when your good fortune will come.

Persevere in what you are doing and do not give up, for your greatest fortune maybe just in your grasp.

In nature, all things mature slowly and in their right season.

_Spring is for planting the seed._

_Summer is for growth and evolvement._

_Fall is for harvest._

_Winter is for rest._

**The same cycle exists in human destiny.**

If your fortune does not come in your youth; the springtime of life.

Remember, this is not the time of harvest.

It is the time of planting.

# Evolve

Develop your mind, and prepare for the future when you are young, but do not always expect the fortune of which you dream, for it must also follow the law of nature.

If you are in the summertime of your life, your mature years, and have still not achieved your success, you must re-examine your life and see what you have done that is wrong, and after correcting your mistakes, persevere, and patiently wait for your success.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/iLBQAlaft9NU4/giphy.gif)

# No matter how discouraged you may become, try not to give up

Throughout history, many great men and women who have made worth wile achievements were told by others that they would fail.

_The mob consciousness is always one of discouragement, defeat, and disaster._

When [**Robert Fulton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fulton) invented the steam-boat, thousands gathered along the Hudson to watch it’s attempt to go upstream against the current.

As the steam began to rise they shouted **“It won't start”** however, when it started moving, they started chanting **“It won't stop, it won't stop!”**

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/mP94uHyKvY1nq/giphy.gif)

# Tune to the Proper Frequency

When you persevere in your efforts you build [**electrical and magnetic current**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectromagnetics) in your brain and body cells which charges your muscles and nerves with an abundance of dynamic energy.

It is much easier to succeed when you have conditioned the forces of your mind with the idea that failure is impossible.

Your continued efforts to achieve your goals are also proof that you have faith in your ability to achieve your objective.

# Conclusion

To get at the crux of a problem and deduce solutions that are designed with simplicity in mind, as to render its root level approach more potent, one must first master their ego and zeal for perseverance.

A properly attuned ego will allow for proper energies to come together to generate the most effective solution with the ease and flow of water.

We now understand that a zeal for perseverance is the backbone of positive iteration, which undoubtedly leads to success.

To know this path, one must engage in the flow of energy that is exemplary of the ocean's tides.

Water perseveres in a stream just as it does among the tides.

_You have to believe in your dreams to allow yourself to enact them._

This means knowing that failure is simply an opportunity to do better.

_**Make your life extraordinary**._
