> [Cogito, ergo sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito%2C_ergo_sum)

`Cogito, ergo sum is a philosophical statement that was made in Latin by René Descartes, usually translated into English as "I think, therefore I am".`

# We Are What We Think

Through an examination of the first hermetic principal of [Mentalism](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism_(philosophy)>), we can begin to understand that the mind is at the root of the universe we encounter each day.

The thoughts we think have a grand effect on our spiritual and physical mentality.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT39CTrFW4nHLdBPpu/giphy.gif)

Thoughts tune us into negative or positive frequencies that can either shroud reality in a veil of confusion or allow for a sharpness of focus that can illuminate the darkest of shadows.

Are you at the helm of your ship of consciousness, navigating it with focus through positive calm waves?

Or are you sailing without a mast, or a crew, allowing your ship to traverse negative choppy waters and iceberg laden seas with reckless abandon?

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriffUeGVXJpGQDUQ/giphy.gif)

Are you in control of your thoughts, or are your thoughts in control of you?

With a simple shift in how we view or approach the waters at hand, we can learn to captain our ships with grace through what would normally be harrowing circumstances.

It's all in your intention.

Think with focused intention and a world of probabilities will open up to you.

## The Cure for Restless Thought

If you've ever felt restless, you know, it's an uncomfortable feeling.

It's the experience of energy bouncing around your body that you don't know how to properly channel.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/5XM7mpg79Aw5W/giphy.gif)

Channeling energy is more about receiving input and producing output than being intuitive, psychic, or inspired.

When we feel restless, we fidget and feel uneasy because we have no outlet for our energy.

_**What is the problem?**_

We don't feel like doing anything in particular, but then again, we don't like the feeling of not doing anything, either.

We can't just sit still or be relaxed, something wants satisfaction, but nothing satisfies.

This energy needs to flow through the proper channels within our body to produce an active, healthy output.

We simply need to allow the restless energy to work its way through the body to resolve itself.

> How does restlessness resolve itself?

The psychology of restlessness suggests that the energy arises from a desire, but one, we can't quite acknowledge.

The experience of restlessness is a stalemate.

In most instances, we should choose to engage in a different task to stir our creative flow.

Eventually, we will find ourselves involved in an activity.

Our restless energy has now been absorbed.

## Your Focus Determines Your Reality

We have found a way to channel restless energy, but could we capture this energy and direct it in a way that benefits us rather than the restlessness; to feel empowered by the output rather than drained?

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/iILcOHstIJ1vGA1yzM/giphy.gif)

We live our lives through channels of energy.

Every day, we exercise this role.

We make choices about how to channel the life force into everyday actions.

Some put more thought into those choices than others.

By becoming aware of this, we're beginning to forge a conscious foundation that will allow us to sharpen our focus to engage in action that facilitates the reality we desire.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3wzV2fYB8qQYo/giphy.gif)

### There are three components of channeling energy:

>

#### The Input

Raw energy. It comes from being alive. The air, we breathe, the food we eat.

Energy is ours to own because it belongs to life itself, and it's ours to use to channel at our will.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarztR1rCyfIpMDS/giphy.gif)

#### The Output

These are experiences we make for ourselves, our actions or behaviors, the things we do.

We channel and transform life energy into our physical bodies and the actions we take with them.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMYn7lUepV1bCr6/giphy.gif)

_**But what happens between the input and output of channeled energy?**_

#### Psychology Of The Mind

We may have ideas about how to spend our energy.

We have values about what's worthwhile.

We make choices. We exercise our will.

With the mind, we shape our energy channels, regulate the incoming energy, then focus and direct it toward our choice of outgoing activity.

As simple and familiar as this visualization of outgoing activity may be, it implies a certain creativity that is intrinsic to the human condition.

> Directed consciousness is the most powerful force in the universe. - [Walter Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Russell)

## Life Grows Where Energy Flows

A river is a source of energy.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/4x4IIzHhscuBi/giphy.gif)

The human mind conceived a mill and channeled the energy of the moving water to grind grain, produce lumber, and generate electricity.

Electricity is a form of energy.

Combining the appropriate pattern of parts with electricity will make a clock keep time.

Energy is energy.

It is raw potential.

It is a neutral force.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/13zSjK5CvaFz44/giphy.gif)

_**How the energy is channeled, determines its effect.**_

Energy is channeled by the patterns through which the energy is applied.

Energy combined with a pattern of application creates the effect.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGxotcT8O9C0d0c/giphy.gif)

This is a basic and familiar process in nature in engineering and our daily lives.

What we experience in life is the result of how we choose to pattern our given life energy.

The thoughts we entertain in our minds become real in the circumstances of our lives.

# Original Thought

If what we think we become, or experience in our lives, why opt for the beaten path?

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xjIsb648nX0pw8kdBd/giphy.gif)

The life we lead, the possessions around us, the circumstances of our days channel the patterns we hold in our minds and channel the life energy into physical expression.

This being the case, ideas are real in themselves and become real in the physical world.

Are you having original thoughts? Are your thoughts your own?

Or, are you thinking someone else's thoughts?

Whoever's thoughts you're thinking have a massive impact on your ability to navigate the universe at hand.

If we wish to construct a self benefiting reality, we must begin with ensuring our thoughts are original and authentic.

> What we assume to be reality is an entirely subjective experience.

## The Mind As The Builder

Personal expectations and attitudes affect how we experience events, process scientific theories, and shape observation.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/cmzp1t3EJ87XNOaHRJ/giphy.gif)

Ideas held in the mind of the observer play a role in what the observer sees in a very basic sense.

Ideas are real.

They are more like original causes themselves than the effects of the experience.

Thoughts are things that suggest reality and influence the visible world to the extent we choose to act.

## Next Dimensional

The best way for us to think of a fourth dimension is to think of an idea.

The psychiatrist, [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung), upon observing the dreams of patients and studying the world's mythology and religious literature concluded, there must exist universal psychic patterns called archetypes.

He said these [archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes) live within a universal mind or a collective unconscious as he called it.

According to Jung, these archetypal patterns govern both the forms of nature, along with the experience and behaviors of human beings.

Ideas exist in another dimension, abstract from material reality.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3fl63IQw5Y10hSWGNy/giphy.gif)

Ideas are the underlying reality that grow into the original causes of what we experience in the visible physical world.

Ideas have their effect through patterns.

Ideas have the capacity to create physical reality.

## Focus On The Real, The Probable

We generally believe that ideas are something that we obtained through experience.

However, ideas exist in another dimension, outside of space and time, and we tune into ideas.

As we tune into an idea, it begins to shape our experience.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/CAxbo8KC2A0y4/giphy.gif)

Every moment of our lives, we're reacting as channels of energy, shaping events through the ideas we hold.

Our role is to choose which ideas or patterns we will hold within our minds.

It is more accurate to say that our choices determine which ideas will create our reality.

We are responsible for our choices.

The thoughts that we entertain are so influential in our lives.

We must consider carefully, which thoughts we let grow within us.

## Plato’s [Theory Of The Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms)

`The theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is a philosophical theory, concept, or world-view, attributed to Plato, that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. According to this theory, ideas in this sense, often capitalized and translated as "Ideas" or "Forms", are the non-physical essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations.`

How do we generally conceptualize an ideal?

To Plato, ideals are the invisible templates or patterns that govern the visible forms of nature.

Ideals are representations of perfection.

The visible forms of ideals can only approximate the ideals that are generating them.

However, ideals can never achieve the ultimate perfection. By their nature, none are exactly perfect.

## Perfection Is Cake. The Cake Is A Lie. There's No Lie In Nature.

A perfectly straight line is an example of an ideal in nature.

There are no naturally perfect straight lines in nature, only approximations.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0LEIXSRRuv9QQIRNI/giphy.gif)

The search for perfection is a search guided by an ideal, but that search that will find only better and better approximations to that elusive ideal of perfection rather than perfection itself.

Perfection exists only as an idealized spirit form in the superconscious region of the mind.

We can conceive of some of its qualities, but we can never find it perfectly realized in physical form.

When we strive to develop a concept of an ideal, we formulate our highest value of it in its most perfect form.

> This is an exercise in raising our consciousness.

An ideal is meant to stimulate emulation and guide our actions, but not to hold out hope of perfection, or worse, _expect nothing less_.

Perfection is something that belongs to the gods, not to humans.

Ideals are the parents of ideas.

Ideals are unreachable patterns of superconscious perfection.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/VEsfbW0pBu145PPhOi/giphy.gif)

## Ideas vs Ideals

As an idea filters down into more tangible patterns of the subconscious regions of the mind, it loses some of its ideal qualities in the specifics of the ideas it generates.

If your highest value can be achieved, it's only an idea and not actually an ideal.

Some people have wealth as their highest value.

We can achieve wealth, however, it's not an ideal.

Wealth is a specific idea generated by the ideal of infinite resources and the lack of any limitation.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMzQmhWK2sQOT1S/giphy.gif)

Some people have happiness as their highest value we can achieve happiness, so it's not necessarily an ideal.

Happiness is a specific idea generated by the ideal for a spiritual paradise, a state of unlimited joy or bliss.

On the other hand, perfect love, harmony, or peace are closer to being ideals.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Sw6OYWKOQY0SsSl5ah/giphy.gif)

They represent ideas of perfection that can provide continual inspiration toward the infinte.

Perfect realization of wealth and happiness are wonderful.

_**So what if they are not ideals? What difference does it make whether your values pertain to ideas or ideals?**_

Once they materialize, ideas die. They no longer motivate.

How many people have achieved wealth only to wonder, "Well, what's next?".

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlzsaupDQvv0lgY/giphy.gif)

Once we obtain the valued ideas we're striving for, there is a letdown feeling.

Anticipation is part of the excitement.

It motivates us and provides enthusiasm.

Only values that are truly based on an ideal can keep us going.

Only ideals can continue to spur inspiration.

# Balanced Forces

Everything in nature strives for balance.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/yHKOzZnHZyjkY/giphy.gif)

Restless, or excess potential is created by unchanneled mental energy; when too much importance is given to a particular object,

Excess potential only appears in instant cases. If not harnessed and focused, it fades.

> How do we harness our excess potential to gain balance?

Detach from the outcome.

When you would normally feel afraid, become aware of this and your reaction will be tempered with knowledge.

Your reaction is the most important thing when striving for balance.

React calmly without attributing true importance to the thing that you're reacting to.

Carry out your responsibilities with integrity.

Begin to see the scales in every action you take.

Let go of resentment and choose not to judge others.

Look for joy every moment.

If something demands too much importance, shift focus.

Love unconditionally.

Avoid idealizing overvaluation.

Avoid vanity.

There is nothing wrong with taking pride in your achievements or loving yourself simply do not become overinflated in a sense of your own worth.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/kWu1jP3coTmFO/giphy.gif)

Become aware of the scale of the different dualities that carry balancing forces of superiority and inferiority.

If one side is held to be more important than the other, balancing forces can become involved and begin to tip the scales.

## Intend What You Pretend

Pure intention is the best form of thought that can combat unbalancing forces, and should drive the way we think.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fvSlj22rEwS9Obijmg/giphy.gif)

Ground your mind in awareness of your reaction and move in a shift towards thinking with focused intention.

Know what you want.

However, do not desire so much as to create interference in thought energy and the transmittal of manifestation.

See the scales for your reaction, do not tip them.

Accept and enjoy what you already have.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/jmqWAjoxFCxJNHD2Kz/giphy.gif)

Money is only an accompanying attribute to real aspiration.

The goal is never the money.

The goal is the house, the traveling, and the adventures or experiences.

Money will always be available for whatever we choose to experience and for whatever we intend; only if we let go of the ideal of perfection in our lives.

Focusing on money can trigger balencing forces of perfection and pull us into imperfection.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/2dI7FZreQAp44/giphy.gif)

It's a negative feedback loop.

## Imperfection In Projected Importance

Through the ideal of perfection, we become aware of outer importance and inner importance in our lives.

In becoming aware of these importances, we must let go of all unbalancing feelings and reactions.

Let go of the idealization of things.

Importance isn't bad on it's own, however, excess importance assigned to an object or event can create excess potential.

Excess potential can stir up pendulums that serve as unbalancing forces, that can throw us into polarity.

Work to diminish the importance of pendulums in your life.

Move towards balance.

Excessive emotions and worries are the direct consequences of projected importance.

## Important Problems

When trying to solve problems, reduce the level of importance associated with the problem.

This way, unbalancing forces will not get in the way of a solution.

Become aware that the problem or situation has arisen as a consequence of projected excessive importance,

When we attribute importance to our assessment, it becomes bogged down in energy of excess potential, as excess importance increases.

If our assessment represents a distortion of reality, the impact of balancing forces should be aimed at eliminating excess potential.

Substitute the habit of negative responses, with the transmission of positive energy.

Become aware that dependent relationships can create excess potential, and we have the choice in how much importance is assigned to a matter.

Become aware that idealization and overestimation end up in disillusionment.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/MPuTZQqOmYKPK/giphy.gif)

It is a simple mental exercise.

Trick your mind to reduce unnecessary importance.

No matter how truly important something is, you have the power to control your reaction to it.

We're able to realize our desires when they are free of excess potential, created by projected importance and dependencies.

Give permission to be yourself.

Do not try to overcome obstacles.

Reduce the amount of importance projected onto them and obstacles overcome themselves.

Take care without worrying.

Become aware of the infinite variables of balance.

Shift into balance.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT8qBit7YomT80d0M8/giphy.gif)

Become aware of all of the energy variables with every decision made.

Become aware of these balancing forces and react by making the appropriate decision with this awareness.

This is the path to solutions.

# Conclusion

It's worth investing the time to decide upon your current ideal and develop a feeling for it.

What is your highest value?

What's the spirit in which you like to live?

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Ex7GZmbMnA4gjIc/giphy.gif)

Defensiveness builds further separation.

The antidote to fear is love, and the antidote to experiences of separateness is to focus on oneness.

If you feel lonely, forget yourself and reach out to someone in love.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/YSe5ozBVRvkVi6VZeF/giphy.gif)

That is the spirit of the higher consciousness.

The higher consciousness is an ideal that can provide continuous inspiration for a lifetime.

To channel the higher self is to attune to an ideal, and then to set one's self aside so that the ideal may express itself.

Ideals are the currency of the higher self.

The ideal you set for yourself, is what determines the qualities of the higher self that you will experience.

The model for channeling the higher self has two parts and they seem to run counter to one another.

One is a structure of fixed point a standard. That's the ideal.

The other part is a free-flowing process. Spontaneity, or a willingness to let go of an ideal, and in doing so, letting yourself go.

If your ideal is set, you can trust in the flow.

Whether energy is a constructive or destructive influence, spiritual or evil in its effect, depends upon how the energy is patterned.

It depends on how you choose to think.

Be open to possibility, and if a possibility exists, love directs action better than hate.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/jqxfS0BF9pFi1C8Rux/giphy.gif)

## All You Need Is Love

Love is a channel of miracles because it can transcend the law of cause and effect.

It can break the rules.

We often read inspiring stories about the power of love making an impossible change for a hopeless situation.

Forgiveness heals, and it brings change.

It's one of Love's creative powers to perform miracles.

We have an opportunity to perform such a miracle almost every day of our lives.

Every day, every moment of our lives, we give of ourselves toward one goal or another.

With every heartbeat we channel love and what our heart dwells upon.

What our minds think about we become or experience in our lives.

We continually channel our energy, our love, our ideas, our ideals, our actions into creating life as we should have it.

I think, therefore I am.

I love, therefore I think.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/DXV7lq5wZtEWI/giphy.gif)
