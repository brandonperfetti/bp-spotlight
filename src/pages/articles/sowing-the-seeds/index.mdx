# Imagine

In our youth, our imaginations run wild with flights of fancy and fear.

Days are spent living out heroic fantasies with friends, while nights can invoke, the nightmare-inducing, ~~**fear of the unknown**~~.

Perhaps the correlation of light : day, and dark : night, maybe a contributing factor in our growing imaginations.

At this age, we're extremely unfamiliar with the polarization of our thoughts (negative and positive).

So much so, that our budding imaginations are easily influenced by strong imprints of our developmental surroundings.

[**Psychology**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)>) notes the strength our imaginations play in developing our long term conceptualization of the world around us.

> What if there was a way to harness the power of our imagination, and leverage it's capacity to work in our favor?

# Planting the Seed

If there is a thing you're trying to attain, or a place in life you strive to be, neither will be fulfilled without first conceiving so in your imagination.

_**It is within your imagination, that you plant the seeds of the crop you wish to reap.**_

The forces of your higher mind are ready and waiting to develop the frequency of vibration you desire.

However, you must hold the image this frequency generates firmly in your mind.

Imagine your dream matured and fulfilled, then go about and externalize it into its physical and material equivalent, in all earnest.

The forces of Man's higher mind are stimulated by the power of his imagination to produce great things.

# Stimulating Imagination

_**How would one combat the imaginative equivalent to writer's block?**_

### Making Use of an Existing Text

- Read a scene from a book and project the scene in your imagination. (Active readers do this regularly)
- Visualize it as _realistic_ as possible.
- See and feel the characters, the environment, their actions, and any other details described in the text.

### Making Use of a Childhood Memory

- Think back to your childhood and recall a moment that you greatly enjoyed.
- Perhaps a Christmas party or birthday.
- In your mind's eye, recall the people there, the things you said and ate, any other details.

### Making Use of Future Scenarios

- Visualize your dream home.
- Visualize a party and the people there.
- Visualize your garden in this dream home.
- What is planted there?

### Making Use of Faux Public Speaking

- Stand before a mirror and imagine speaking to a vast auditorium.
- Speak aloud or to yourself.
- Make the topic of a subject in which you are fluent and familiar.
- The brain is stimulated by this exercise and makes it possible for you to speak more fluently when you need to express yourself.

### Making Use of Dreams of Wealth

- Imagine having a million dollars.
- This mental exercise helps stimulate the response centers of your brain for building a fortune.
- If you cannot imagine yourself being rich, it will be difficult to ever attract a fortune.

_**If these recommendations seem cliche or childish, that's kind of the point.
We're trying to engage your childlike subconscious.
It understands simplistic methods.**_

> "Your mind will take shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions." [**Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 5.16**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations)

_**We know that we have a vivid and active imagination, however, how could we better passively direct it towards positive manifestation?**_

# Why So Curious?

Curiosity leads to _discoveries_...

Curiosity seems to have been implanted in the consciousness of man for a specific purpose.

This divine emotion makes him discontented with the world as it is, and causes him to search for new ways to change things, to improve them, and give Man greater luxury.

Look about yourself, in your work, and see how you can improve things.

Adjust workflows and processes with efficiency and pragmatism in mind.

Many inventions born of Man's curiosity caused him to further wonder if he could improve on the methods used within his business.

_**Don't be a renaissance man, **be** the renaissance, man!**_

# Converting Negative Frequency to Positive Frequency

Analyze a common invention and try to figure out the guiding principle involved in its mechanism.

_**What problem is being solved?**_

Understand the many solutions in place around you and how they, at their root, are derived; transmuting negative experiences into positive.

Look around in your garden at the fruit vegetables and flowers and try to reason out the method in which they draw out the nourishment from the soul of the earth to create their products.

When it thunders, or lightning strikes, try to understand the physics as to why these phenomena naturally occur.

Stimulate the curiosity response centers of your brain by wondering how other people live around the world.

When you listen to beautiful music or read masterful or interesting stories, try to analyze the emotions that caused these authors or composers to create their works.

Engaging your mind in this manner trains your subconscious to approach negative situations with a solution-based mindset; facilitating change towards the positive.

# Conclusion

Imagination and curiosity are the seeds you must sow if you wish to reap the benefits of your dedication.

To achieve your wildest goals, you must delve deep within your psyche, and feel the emotion that arises from imagining your goal achieved.

_**Breathe it. Live it.**_

We're conditioned to ignore our emotions, our feelings, and our intuition when we're children.

These are senses most individuals desperately need to re-attune themselves with.

Re-engage with your childlike, imaginative, soul to tap back into the muse of creativity.

> "If you find something very difficult to achieve yourself, don't imagine it impossible - for anything possible and proper for another person can be achieved as easily by you." [Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations)

This may be the beginning of a series of posts, inspired by Anthony Norvell (1908â€“1990), a popular writer and lecturer on occult and esoteric topics.
He had a knack for making old and difficult ideas into workable, practical, and accessible methods.
[**The Million Dollar Secret Hidden in Your Mind**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/039916197X/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_aSC4EbD6JBQK5), originally published in 1963, was among his most popular works.
